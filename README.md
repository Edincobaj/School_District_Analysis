# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
In this analysis Maria and her supervisor has tasked us with adjusting our previous analysis to exclude data from Thomas High School's 9th grade reading and math tests. This is due to a possible case of academic dishonestly. Once the data is extracted we'll be able to analize the effect that this possibly false data had on the rest of the schools.
## Results
### District Summary
The results in our analysis show very slight changes in our district summary. There was a slight decrease in percent of students passing in both reading and math when excluding the 9th graders from our dataframe. From 74.98085 to 74.76039 in math and from 85.805463 to 85.65966 in reading. We also see a similar decrease in the district average scores for math and reading. When excluding the 9th graders from Thomas High School we go from 78.985371 to 78.930533 in math and from 74.980853 to 74.760392 in reading. 
These changes can be seen below:

### School Summary
Similarly to the district, there is only a slight change to the average math and reading scores when we look at the school summary. After excluding the 9th graders the average scores go from 83.418349 to 83.350937 in math and 83.848930 to 83.896082 in reading. Where we really see a big change in our data is when looking at the percent of passing students in each category. Reading scores decrease from 97.31 to 69.66, Math scores decrease from 93.27 to 66.91. We see no changes in the rank of the school or what bin the school is in.
